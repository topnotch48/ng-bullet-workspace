# What is **ng-bullet**?

For a complete and detailed answer please read my article at [medium](https://blog.angularindepth.com/angular-unit-testing-performance-34363b7345ba).

For a library description with some useful examples and performance comparison please go to [bullet's](projects/ng-bullet/README.md) project repo.

# Update

Please excuse me, but it seems like I don't have time to invest into this library anymore. This being said please let me provide you with an even better alternative in my opinion - [spectator](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator), backed by Netanel Basal. It should provide you a similar technique to speed up your tests, plus many more useful tools to improve testing of your application. Excuse me once again for inconvenience.
